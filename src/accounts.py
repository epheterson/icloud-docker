"""Household accounts: Apple IDs beyond the main one.

Configured as a list under ``accounts:``::

    accounts:
      - id: alex                          # username optional

Without a username the member types their Apple ID on the sign-in
page, and the first successful sign-in pins it to the account
(``<config dir>/accounts/<id>/account.json``). Each account keeps its own
saved session in ``<config dir>/accounts/<id>/session_data``, written by
the sign-in pages (``src.member_signin``) and resumed by the member sync
(``src.member_sync``).

What a member backs up (``member_config``): their personal photo library,
into ``<photos destination>/<id>``, and their iCloud Drive, into a folder
beside the main account's (``drive/Eric`` -> ``drive/<id>``), never inside
it, where the main account's cleanup would delete what it does not
recognise. Not the Shared Library: the primary already backs it up.
Obsolete-file cleanup is off unless the entry turns it on. Drive is on
whenever the main account syncs Drive, unless the entry says
``drive: false`` (the member's own page has a switch). An entry may change
a few settings::

    accounts:
      - id: alex
        photos:
          library_destinations: {PrimarySync: Alex}
          folder_format: "%Y/%m/%d"
          all_folder: ""           # dated folders straight under Alex/
          adopt: icloudpd          # recognise an icloudpd tree in place
        drive:
          enabled: true
          destination: drive/Alex  # default: beside the main account's
          remove_obsolete: true
