"""Back up household members' photo libraries.

One daemon thread, beside the primary account's sync loop, for every
account under ``accounts:``. For each member with a pinned Apple ID and a
saved session (both written by the sign-in pages, ``src.member_signin``):

1. Resume the saved session. Session-only: no password is ever stored or
   sent, so a session Apple no longer accepts marks the member "needs
   sign-in" and nothing is retried until they sign in again.
2. If the member adopts another tool's tree (``photos.adopt``) and nobody
   has started their backup yet, write the read-only report
   (``src.member_report``) for the household page and stop there.
3. Otherwise run an ordinary photo pass with the member's config
   (``accounts.member_config``), then their Drive when it is on, its
   state in the member's own file.

The primary's loop is untouched: its handlers can sleep for half an hour
on a sign-in problem, and none of that reaches here, nor the other way
round. A member's crash is logged and recorded on their card; the thread
carries on with the next member and the next cycle.
