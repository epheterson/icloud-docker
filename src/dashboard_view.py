"""What the dashboard says, worked out from what ``/api/status`` already has.

The dashboard answers one question, "is everyone's iCloud safely copied?",
and offers one tap when it isn't. Everything here is a view of the status
payload (``web._build_status``) and the log tail the page already reads:
no disk, network or lock is added to the page load.

- ``people``: one entry per Apple ID, the main account first, each with a
  tone, one sentence, and at most one action.
- ``headline``: the sentence at the top, from the people.
- ``log_summary``: warnings and errors in the tail, so the log can stay
  folded unless it has something to say.
